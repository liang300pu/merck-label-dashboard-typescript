# Merck Label Dashboard Client Developers Guide

This is a guide for developers who want to contribute to the Merck Label Dashboard client.

## Misc
Through out the code you will notice the use of Luxon. Luxon is a library that provides a wrapper around the native Date object. It provides a more robust API for dealing with dates and times. It also provides a more robust API for dealing with time zones. Luxon is a drop in replacement for the native Date object. You can read more about Luxon [here](https://moment.github.io/luxon/).
Its main use case is being able to convert from the dates that prisma likes (ISO) and the dates that material ui likes (yyyy-MM-dd)
